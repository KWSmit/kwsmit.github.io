Today I added a new robot to my site: [KSmRover](../../../robot_projects/ksmrover.html). It's a robot that can be remotely
controlled over the web. It can be used on a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 brick or
mindsensors.com PiStorms. The latter can be used with a picamera to view live
videofeed where it's moving.
