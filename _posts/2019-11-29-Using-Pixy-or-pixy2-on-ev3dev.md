I have updated my tutorial about using the Pixy camera on ev3dev for the new
Pixy2. Now you will find information and sample code (in Python) for both
cameras.

On ev3dev there is a difference in using Pixy or Pixy2: ev3dev does contain
a driver for Pixy, but not for Pixy2. But itâ€™s easy to use Pixy2 by setting
up direct I2C communication between the EV3 and Pixy2. Both methods are
explained.

You can find my tutorial on <a href="https://github.com/KWSmit/Pixy_ev3dev" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, but you can also find a brief tutorial
on the <a href="https://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/using-pixy-camera/" target="_blank">ev3dev</a> website.
