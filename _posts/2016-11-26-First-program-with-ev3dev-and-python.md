Yeah, I made my first robot with ev3dev and Python. Just a simple one: 
robot is controlled by the EV3 remote control.
ev3dev is a Debian Linux-based operating system that runs on several 
LEGO® MINDSTORMS compatible platforms including the LEGO® MINDSTORMS EV3 
and Raspberry Pi-powered BrickPi (Dexter Industries) or PiStorms 
(mindsensors.com). I find ev3dev an amazing programming environment for 
the EV3 and it's my favorite now. Besides two EV3's I also own 
a PiStorms v2 and it's great you can use ev3dev on both platforms.
