  <p>
		Welcome to my website about LEGO Mindstorms robots and more. Through this 
		website	I like to share my experiences and thoughts about building robots 
		and programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm not a professional programmer, just an enthousiastic hobbyist. All of 
		the information on this site is the result of my personal learning process: 
		experimenting, reading books, searching Internet, forum posts, etc. 
		I can't guarantee all information is 100% correct or well enough 
		explained. So be careful when using anything of it. Don't take 
		anything for granted. I just hope I can inspire you or can give you 
		a hint or idea for your own projects.
  </p>
  <p>
		I try to direct you as much as possible to the places I find very 
		helpful. So you can find your own way in looking for further information.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are free to use all my programs and robot designs. All programs on this 
		site and in my Github repositories worked fine for me, but I can't 
		guarantee they will work for you. For sure my programs can be improved 
		in syntax and style. Any suggestions about this are welcome.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also have a look at my YouTube channel 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdBiiGGnC-iWNKDV7QE1AeA?"

	<p>
		With kind regards,<br>Kees
